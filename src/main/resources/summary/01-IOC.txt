-Container maintain your calss dependecies
-object injected at run time not compile time
-An object accept the dependencies for construction intead of constructing them

benifits of IOC:
-reduce noise in your code : no copying of constructios again and again ..no noise
-reduces object coupling
-reduces defects that arises from incorrect object construction
- focus on the API contracts
